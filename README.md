There are 150 data points across 5 columns
4 of the columns are numeric and one is categorical
The 4 numeric columns are ....
sepal_length has a mean value of 5.84, and its values range from a minimum of 4.3 to a maximum of 7.9

petal_length has the largest spread in values, as its standard deviation is 1.76, whereas the other numeric columns have standard deviations less than 1 - we would expect to see a wider histogram for petal length than the other numeric features.

The observations are evenly distributed between the species, with 50 observations of each of iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

### Histograms

There are many observations of very narrow petals, and otherwise a spread of values between 1 and 2.5 cm. The large number of narrow petals may be due to the iris setosa observations, as this species has a significantly narrower petal on average than the other two species.
